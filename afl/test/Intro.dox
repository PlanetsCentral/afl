/** \namespace afl::test
    \brief Testing

    This namespace contains classes for testing.
    Those classes use afl::except::AssertionFailedException for error reporting.
    They are not necessarily optimized for efficiency.

    In contrast to "InternalXXX" classes, we do not expect to use these in production code. */
