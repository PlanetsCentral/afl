/** \namespace afl::functional
    \brief Working with functions

    This namespace contains classes that represent functions.
    A special case of functions are mappings from a discrete, enumerable set.

    We provide higher-order functions like fold().

    The general idea is that functions are constructed on the stack, as temporaries.
    Therefore, no special means to manage lifetime have been provided. */
